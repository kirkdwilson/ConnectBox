# ConnectBox
ConnectBox custom files
The files in this repository are designed to image onto a Connectbox.  While the Connectbox Github contains the source and release versions, this repository only contains release versions with added customizations.  These include Fat32 files on the first partition for usage as storage internal to the connect box.
